In the land of spreadsheets and green fields bright,  
Where stats and dreams take noble flight,  
I sought to be Ian Graham, wise and grand,  
In the realm of fantasy, I make my stand.  
  
A league of shadows, yet hope springs free,  
In the make-believe Premier League, where none can see  
That numbers and whims, and forms unknown,  
Shall guide my quest to take the throne.  

**Yet thou, O brave adventurer, dost not wander alone!**  
Embark on your journey, with stats well honed,  
At the portal of Fantasyâ€™s light:  
[fantasy.infinitetrooper.com](https://fantasy.infinitetrooper.com), for thy delight.
